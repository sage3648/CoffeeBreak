# CoffeeBreak
Uhack 2019 project Git

 Coffee Break is an innovative browser extension that encourages people to take regular breaks throughout their working day by rewarding them for making and keeping healthy habits. Whether they be working a 9-5 job, or cramming for exams, the individual users of our product will receive gentle but frequent reminders, as well as suggestions for "break activities". These activities could be anything from drinking a glass of water or doing a 5 minute mindfulness exercise to inviting a coworker along to grab a coffee at a local cafe.
